                    My Dearest Soonbee, <br><br>
                    Happy 21st Birthday, Loser!!</p>
                
                    <p>As I'm writing this letter, I find myself reflecting on how lucky I am to have you in my life. 
                    You fill my days with so much happiness and joy, it's incomparable, 
                    and I'm glad you've let me be a part of your life as you enter a new chapter.</p>
                
                    <p>You're officially 21 (Haha, look who's old now). 
                    It's a big milestone, and I'm happy I can share it with you. Since I've met you, there's never been a dull moment. 
                    You've given me lots of laughter and, if I'm being honest, lots of nervousness. 
                    But taking that risk and talking to you is one of the best decisions I've ever made.</p>
                
                    <p>You're the sun in my life, and your love warms my heart like a catchy song that never leaves your memory. 
                    I honestly didn't think I could care so much for someone, but every day with you is a cherished moment, 
                    and I'm grateful to have you as my partner.</p>
                
                    <p>One of the things I adore the most about you is how you light up when you're playing music. 
                    Seeing you immersed in your passion, expressing yourself so beautifully, is really breathtaking, and I can't help but keep my eyes on you. 
                    I hope to see more of these moments because watching you perform has become one of my favorite experiences.</p>
                
                    <p>As you continue onto the next stage of this journey called life, the world's going to open up to you in new and exciting ways, 
                    which can be overwhelming. But I want you to know that I'll be here, supporting and cheering you on! 
                    You're not just talented and intelligent; you're remarkable in every way, and I'm standing by as your number 1 fan.</p>
                
                    <p>So, here's to your birthday! Let's make this year one filled with unforgettable memories, laughter, and love.<br><br>
                    Happy Birthday, my lil' avocado. I hope this year is as amazing as you are.<br><br>
                    With all my love,<br>
                    David</p>
